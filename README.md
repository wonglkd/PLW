PLW: Probabilistic Local Walks
==============================

Getting started
---------------

1. Unzip the package.
2. In the directory 'bin', open up a Terminal / Command Line Prompt window.
3. Run PLW using the following syntax: `./PLW <input.txt> <output_clusters.txt>`  

   For example, to run PLW on the supplied DIP dataset, type the next line:  
   **Linux/Mac**:
   ```./PLW_MacOSX ../inputData/ppi.dip.cleaned.txt clusters.txt```  
   **Windows**:
   ```PLW_Win_cygwin ../inputData/ppi.dip.cleaned.txt clusters.txt```
4. Using this example, PLW will run and produce a tab-delimited file called `clusters.txt` in
   the same directory containing the predicted complex. Each line of the output file represents
   a complex, with the first number representing the numeric ID of the complex, the second
   number representing the number of proteins in the predicted complex, and the remaining
   line representing the proteins in the complex. A summary of PLW's progress will be sent to
   `stderr`.

	Further information on the usage of PLW and its command-line options can be found in
	`bin/README.txt`.
